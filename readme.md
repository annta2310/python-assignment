In this whole program of nine weeek i learned a lot about python which is to intresting as well. 

In the first code file star.py  . i researched about turtel module , how to import that, to play with that and make different design while using pyhton as i try to  make star  using red and yellow colour.

## Turtle: (star)
1. The `color()` function is called with two arguments: "red" and "yellow". This sets the pen color to red and the fill color to yellow.
2. The `begin_fill()` function is called to begin filling the shape with the specified fill color.
3. A `while` loop is used to draw the shape. The loop continues as long as the absolute value of the turtle's position is greater than 1.
4. Inside the loop, the `forward()` function is called to move the turtle forward by 200 units.
5. The `left()` function is called to turn the turtle left by 170 degrees.
6. If the turtle's position is within 1 unit of the origin, the `break` statement is used to exit the loop.
7. The `end_fill()` function is called to fill the shape with the specified fill color.
8. The `done()` function is called to keep the window open until the user closes it.

In the second code file test.py   . i make two different classes which are class person and class cat to show their appearence and identity.

## Person Class

The `Person` class is a simple class that takes in two attributes during initialization: `age` and `gender`. 
## Cat Class

This is a simple example of a `Cat` class in Python. The class has three attributes: `name`, `age`, and `colour`.

In the third code file calulator.py  .  I used different arithmetic operations to make small calucator. in which input are already given.


# Basic Arithmetic Operations in Python

This is a simple Python script that demonstrates basic arithmetic operations.

## Example Usage

To run the script, simply execute it using a Python interpreter. 

In the fourth file person.py. i tried to make login credential using username and password with a qutation of greeting a person.

# Person Class

This class defines a person with a name and provides methods for greeting and logging in on page.

## Methods

### `__init__(self, name)`

Initialize a new instance of the `Person` class with a given name.

### `greet(self)`

Print a greeting message with the person's name.

### `login(self)`

Prompt the user to enter their username and password, and check if they match the valid credentials. If the credentials are valid, print a success message. Otherwise, print an error message.
